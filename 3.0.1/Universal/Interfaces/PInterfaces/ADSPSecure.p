{
For secure connections, the eom field of ioParams contains two single-bit flags
(instead of a zero/non-zero byte). They are an encrypt flag (see below), and an
eom flag.  All other bits in that field should be zero.

To write an encrypted message, you must set an encrypt bit in the eom field of
the ioParams of your write call. Note: this flag is only checked on the first
write of a message (the first write on a connection, or the first write following
a write with eom set.
}

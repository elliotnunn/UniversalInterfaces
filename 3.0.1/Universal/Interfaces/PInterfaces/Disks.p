{
	Note:
	
	qLink is usually the first field in queues, but back in the MacPlus
	days, the DrvSts record needed to be expanded.  In order to do this without
	breaking disk drivers that already added stuff to the end, the fields 
	where added to the beginning.  This was originally done in assembly language
	and the record was defined to start at a negative offset, so that the qLink
	field would end up at offset zero.  When the C and pascal interfaces where
	made, they could not support negative record offsets, so qLink was no longer
	the first field.  Universal Interfaces are auto generated and don't support
	negative offsets for any language, so DrvSts in Disks.a has qLinks at a 
	none zero offset.  Assembly code which switches to Universal Interfaces will
	need to compensate for that.

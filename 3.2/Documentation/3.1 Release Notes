Universal Interfaces & Libraries Release Notes 
==============================================

Version: Universal Interfaces 3.1
Date:    February 12, 1998
Author:  Nick Kledzik


=================
Important Notice
=================

The FOR_≈ (e.g. FOR_SYSTEM7_ONLY) conditionals have been removed 
from ConditionalMacros.h/p/a/r.  If you are using any of them
in your source code you should remove them.  ConditionalMacros.h
now defines them in such a way that you will get an error
during compilation if you try to use them.  


==========================================
New Features in Universal Interfaces 3.1
==========================================

-	Latest interfaces and stub libraries for:
		Mac OS 8.1 
		Appearance 1.0.2
		ColorSync 2.5 (late beta)
		QuickTime 3.0 (late beta)
		Quickdraw 3D 1.5.4
		QuickTime VR 2.1

-	More cross-platform support:

		- Function names that collide with other OS toolbox functions now have a "Mac"
		  prefix, optional on MacOS and required on other OS's. (e.g. SetPort -> MacSetPort).
		  
		- Types.h has been renamed to MacTypes.h

-	New interface files (ComponentIncludes) for component writers. These files are helpful
	when implementing your own component. 
	
-	New files:
		Endian.h
		HFSVolumes.h
		JManager.h
		MacTypes.h
		QTML.h
		SFNTLayoutTypes.h
		UnicodeConverter.h

- 	Pascal specific changes:

		- Use UInt16 and UInt32 instead of INTEGER and LONGINT anywhere the
		  C headers used unsigned short and unsigned long.
		  
		- Instead of function pointers being defined as simply ProcPtr, they
		  are now defined as typed functions if the compiler supports it.

- 	All interfaces files now have CKID resources to make the files read-only.

==========================
Known Bugs and Limitations
==========================

	- SIOW.r
		The version of SIOW.r that currently ships with MPW is incompatible with
		3.1 Universal Interfaces.  To fix you will need to change occurances of
		"#if SystemSevenOrLater" in ALRT resources to "#if ALRT_RezTemplateVersion == 1"
		"#if SystemSevenOrLater" in WIND resources to "#if WIND_RezTemplateVersion == 1"

	- Disassembler.h
		The version of Disassembler.h that currently ships with MPW is incompatible with
		3.1 Universal Interfaces. 
		
		To fix you will need to change:

			#ifndef __TYPES__	
			typedef unsigned char Boolean;
			enum {false, true};
			#endif
		
		to:
		
			#ifndef __TYPES__	
			#include <Types.h>
			#endif

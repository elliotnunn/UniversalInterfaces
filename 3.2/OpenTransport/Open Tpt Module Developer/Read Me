About the Developer Kit

This developer kit was created using the PreRelease MPW environment from E.T.O. #20.

The file Devices.h is required for PCI driver development.  This file
supersedes the file Devices.h from the E.T.O. #20 release.  It is modified from
the original Devices.h in order to work with E.T.O. #20 header files.

This folder also contains the file NameRegistry.h which was used to build 
Open Transport. 

Compiling STREAMS modules:
==========================

STREAMS modules should be compiled by #include <OpenTptModule.h>.  A STREAMS module or driver should never #include <OpenTransport.h> directly.  In addition, a STREAMS modules or driver should not #include any of the client header files.  There are incompatibilities between kernel and client header files in an attempt to keep this from inadvertently happening.

Linking with Open Transport Libraries:
===============================

WARNING:
NEVER, NEVER link a STREAMS module or driver against an Open Transport client library.

For 68K:
If you are writing a STREAMS module or driver, link with OpenTptModule.o.

If you are writing a port scanning library, link with OpenTptKernelUtils.o.  Never link a port scanning library with OpenTptModule.o - this will cause the whole STREAM environment to load, which is undesireable for a port scanner.

For 68K modules or drivers, you must also link with LibraryManager.o from the ASLM SDK, since your module or driver must be an ASLM-loadable module.

For PPC:
If you are writing a STREAMS module or driver, link with OpenTptModuleLib.

If you are writing a port scanning library, link with OpenTptKernelUtilLib.  Never link a port scanning library with OpenTptModuleLib - this will cause the whole STREAM environment to load, which is undesireable for a port scanner.

If you are using ASLM for your STREAMS module, you must also link with LibraryManagerPPC.o.

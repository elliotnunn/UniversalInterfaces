Installing Universal Interfaces into CodeWarrior
=================================================

Version: Universal Interfaces 3.3.2
Date:    April 12, 2000
Author:  Nick Kledzik


For Pro 5:

	Replace the folder:
		'MacOS Support:Universal:' 
	with the folder:
		'UniversalInterfaces3.3.2:Universal:'
	
	Remove the following folder:
	     'MacOS Support:OpenTransport:'
	Or rename it to:
	     'MacOS Support:(OpenTransport)'
	
	Most of OpenTransport is now integrated into Universal Interfaces.  If you 
	are doing 68K or using the debug libraries from OpenTransport, you will
	want to keep the OpenTransport folder.

	Rebuild any pre-compiled headers you use that were built with older headers.
	The most common is MacHeaders.mcp in MacOS Support:MacHeaders.  But you may
	also find conflicts in MSL or custom precompiled headers in your own projects.
	

For Pro 4:

	In the Finder, do the following:
		
		Universal C headers:
			Drag contents of:
				'Universal Interfaces 3.3.2:Universal:Interfaces:CIncludes:'
			into

		Universal Rez headers:

				'Universal Interfaces 3.3.2:Universal:Interfaces:RIncludes:'

				'Universal Interfaces 3.3.2:Universal:Libraries:StubLibraries:'

				'Universal Interfaces 3.3.2:Universal:Libraries:PPCLibraries:'

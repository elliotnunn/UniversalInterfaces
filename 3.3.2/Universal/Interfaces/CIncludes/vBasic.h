  This section is a collection of algebraic functions that uses the AltiVec       
  instruction set, and is designed to facilitate vector processing in             
  mathematical programming. Following table indicates which functions are covered

Following is a short description of functions in this section:
                                                                         
      Add:      It takes two vectors of data elements and adds each element         
                of the second vector to the corresponding element of the first      
                vector and puts the result in the associated data element of the    
                destination register.

      Subtract: It takes two vectors of data elements and subtracts each element    
                of the second vector from the corresponding element of the first    
                vector and puts the result in the associated data element of the    
                destination register.

      Multiply: It takes two vectors of data elements and multiplies each element   
                of the first vector by the corresponding element of the second      
                vector and puts the result in the associated data element of the    
                destination register. 

      Divide:   It takes two vectors of data elements and divides each element      
                of the first vector by the corresponding element of the second      
                vector and puts the result in the associated data element of the    
                destination register. A pointer is passed to the function to get   
                the remainder.

      Shift:    It takes a vector of two 64-bit data elements or one 128-bit
                data element and shifts it to right or left, in a logical or 
                algebraic manner, using a shift factor that is passed as an
                arguement to the function.

      Rotate:   It takes a vector of two 64-bit data elements or one 128-bit
                data element and rotates it to right or left, using a shift 
               factor that is passed as an arguement to the function.

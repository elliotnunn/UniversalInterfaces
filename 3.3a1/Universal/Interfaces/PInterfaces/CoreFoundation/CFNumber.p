FUNCTION CFNumberGetTypeID: CFTypeID; C;

{ Creates a CFNumber with the given value. The type of number pointed
to by the valuePtr is specified by type. If type is a floating point
type and the value represents one of the infinities or NaN, the
well-defined CFNumber for that value is returned. If either of valuePtr
or type is an invalid value, the result it undefined. }
FUNCTION CFNumberCreate(allocator: CFAllocatorRef; theType: CFNumberType; valuePtr: UNIV Ptr): CFNumberRef; C;

{ Returns the storage format of the CFNumber's value.  Note that
this is not necessarily the type provided in CFNumberCreate(). }
FUNCTION CFNumberGetType(number: CFNumberRef): CFNumberType; C;

{ Returns the size in bytes of the type of the number. }
FUNCTION CFNumberGetByteSize(number: CFNumberRef): CFIndex; C;

{ Returns TRUE if the type of the CFNumber's value is one of the defined floating point types. }
FUNCTION CFNumberIsFloatType(number: CFNumberRef): BOOLEAN; C;

{ Copies the CFNumber's value into the space pointed to by
valuePtr, as the specified type. If conversion needs to take
place, the conversion rules follow human expectation and not
C's promotion and truncation rules.  If the conversion is
lossy, or the value is out of range, FALSE is returned. Best
attempt at conversion will still be in *valuePtr.  }
FUNCTION CFNumberGetValue(number: CFNumberRef; numType: CFNumberType; valuePtr: UNIV Ptr): BOOLEAN; C;

{ Compares the two CFNumber instances. If conversion of the
types of the values is needed, the conversion and comparison
follow human expectations and not C's promotion and comparison
rules. Negative zero compares less than positive zero.
Positive infinity compares greater than everything except
itself, to which it compares equal. Negative infinity compares
less than everything except itself, to which it compares equal.
Unlike standard practice, if both numbers are NaN, then they
compare equal; if only one of the numbers is NaN, then the NaN
compares greater than the other number if it is negative, and
smaller than the other number if it is positive. [Note that in
CFEqual() with two CFNumbers, if either or both of the numbers
is NaN, FALSE is returned.] }

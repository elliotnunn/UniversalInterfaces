FUNCTION CFURLCreateWithBytes(allocator: CFAllocatorRef; {CONST}VAR URLBytes: UInt8; length: CFIndex; encoding: CFStringEncoding; baseURL: CFURLRef): CFURLRef; C;
{ Escapes any character that is not 7-bit ASCII with the byte-code }
{ for the given encoding.  If escapeWhitespace is true, whitespace }
{ characters (' ', '\t', '\r', '\n') will be escaped also (desirable }

{ filePath should be the URL's path expressed as a path of the type }
{ fsType.  If filePath is not absolute, the resulting URL will be }
{ considered relative to the current working directory (evaluated }
{ at creation time).  isDirectory determines whether filePath is }
{ treated as a directory path when resolving against relative path }
{ components }
FUNCTION CFURLCreateWithFileSystemPath(allocator: CFAllocatorRef; filePath: CFStringRef; pathStyle: CFURLPathStyle; isDirectory: BOOLEAN): CFURLRef; C;
{ Returns the URL's path in a form suitable for file system use. }
{ The path has been fully processed for the file system type requested }
{ by fsType.  If resolveAgainstBase is TRUE, then the URL's path is first }
{ resolved against that of its base URL (if a base URL exists) before being returned. }
FUNCTION CFURLCreateStringWithFileSystemPath(allocator: CFAllocatorRef; anURL: CFURLRef; pathStyle: CFURLPathStyle; resolveAgainstBase: BOOLEAN): CFStringRef; C;
{ Creates a new URL by resolving the relative portion of relativeURL against its base. }
FUNCTION CFURLCopyAbsoluteURL(relativeURL: CFURLRef): CFURLRef; C;

{ Returns the base URL if it exists }
FUNCTION CFURLGetBaseURL(anURL: CFURLRef): CFURLRef; C;
{ All URLs can be broken into two pieces - the scheme (preceding the first colon) and the resource }
{ specifier (following the first colon).  Most URLs are also "standard" URLs conforming to RFC 1808 }
{ (available from www.w3c.org).  This category includes URLs of the file, http, https, and ftp }
{ schemes, to name a few.  Standard URLs start the resource specifier with two slashes ("//"), and }
{ can be broken into 4 distinct pieces - the scheme, the net location, the path, and further }
{ resource specifiers (typically an optional parameter, query, and/or fragment).  The net location }
{ appears immediately following the two slashes and goes up to the next slash; it's format is }
{ scheme-specific, but is usually composed of some or all of a username, password, host name, and }
{ port.  The path is a series of path components separated by slashes; if the net location is }
{ present, the path always begins with a slash.  Standard URLs can be relative to another URL, in }
{ which case at least the scheme and possibly other pieces as well come from the base URL (see RFC }
{ 1808 for precise details when resolving a relative URL against its base).  The full URL is therefore }
{ <scheme> "://" <net location> <path, always starting with a slash> <additional resource specifiers> }
{ If a given CFURL can be decomposed (that is, conforms to RFC 1808), you can ask for each of the four }
{ basic pieces (scheme, net location, path, and resource specifer) separately, as well as for its base }
{ URL.  The basic pieces are returned with any percent escape sequences still in place (although note }
{ that the scheme may not legally include any percent escapes); this is to allow the caller to distinguish }
{ between percent sequences that may have syntactic meaning if replaced by the character being escaped }
{ (for instance, a '/' in a path component).  Since only the individual schemes know which characters }
{ are syntactically significant, CFURL cannot safely replace any percent escape sequences.  However, }
{ you can use CFStringCreateReplacingPercentEscapes() to create a new string with the percent escapes }
{ removed.  The first argument is the original string containing percent escapes; the second argument }
{ is a string containing any characters that, if escaped in the original string, should NOT be replaced. }
{ Note that this function may return the original string (retained) if the original string contains no }
{ escape sequences to be processed. }
{ If a given CFURL can not be decomposed, you can ask for its scheme and its resource specifier; asking }
{ it for its net location or path will return NULL. }
{ All of the methods discussed above do not require an autorelease pool to be in place. }
{ To get more refined information about the components of a decomposable CFURL, you may ask for more }
{ specific pieces of the URL, expressed with the percent escapes removed.  These functions require an }
{ autorelease pool to be in place, as they will return an autoreleased CFString.  They are }
{ CFURLHostName(), CFURLPortNumber() (actually returns an Int32; does not use the autorelease pool), }
{ CFURLUserName(), CFURLPassword(), CFURLQuery(), CFURLParameters(), and CFURLFragment().  Because the }
{ parameters, query, and fragment of an URL may contain scheme-specific syntaxes, these methods take a }
{ second argument, giving a list of characters which should NOT be replaced if percent escaped.  For }
{ instance, the ftp parameter syntax gives simple key-value pairs as "<key>=<value>;"  Clearly if a key }
{ or value includes either '=' or ';', it must be escaped to avoid corrupting the meaning of the }
{ parameters, so the caller may request the parameter string as }
{ CFStringRef myParams = CFURLParameters(ftpURL, CFSTR("=;%")); }
{ requesting that all percent escape sequences be replaced by the represented characters, except for escaped }
{ '=', '%' or ';' characters.  If you are not interested in any escape sequences being left in, pass NULL for the }
{ second argument. }
{ Returns TRUE if anURL conforms to RFC 1808 }

FUNCTION CFURLCopyPath(anURL: CFURLRef): CFStringRef; C;
{ Returns whether anURL's path represents a directory }

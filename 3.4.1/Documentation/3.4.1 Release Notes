Universal Interfaces & Libraries Release Notes 
==============================================

Version: Universal Interfaces 3.4.1
Date:    September 13, 2001


=========
Overview
=========

The 3.4.1 Universal Interfaces are for use when
developing for CarbonLib 1.5, Mac OS 9.1,
Mac OS X 10.1, or QuickTime 5.0.1 using CFM or 
classic 68k runtimes.

When developing on Mac OS X and building for Mach-O,
you should instead use framework header files 
(e.g. #include <Carbon/Carbon.h>).  

If you want your source code to be able to compile
on Mac OS X and on classic Mac OS, you should continue
to use "flat" includes (e.g. #include <Dialogs.h>)
in your source code and when building on Mac OS X, 
add -I/Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon to your compiler
search path.  That directory contains files in the
flat namespace (e.g. Dialogs.h) which redirect to
the appropriate framework header (e.g. Carbon/Carbon.h).


==================================================
Notes on CarbonLib 1.5 development
==================================================

- CarbonLib 1.5 is designed to run on Mac OS 8.6 
  through OS 9.1 
  
- Not all CarbonLib functions are available on older
  System versions.  Just as you would for a 
  traditional application, your application's
  code should use Gestalt and/or other mechanisms to
  see if a particular manager or function is available
  before calling it.

- The CarbonLib stub library is constructed to cause  
  the linker to automatically weak link symbols in  
  CarbonLib that might not be available when running 
  on a pre Mac OS 9 system.
 
- There is a new stub library named CarbonFrameworkLib.
  It contains functions that are implemented on Mac OS X,
  but have not (and may never be) implemented in CarbonLib.
  If you link with it (in addition to CarbonLib) you will
  automatically be weak-linked with those symbols.  This
  enables you to more easily write applications that take
  advantage of Carbon functionality available when
  running on Mac OS X.

 *  SetApplicationDockTileImage()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Sets the image for the tile in the dock that represents your
 *    application while it is running. If you set the image, it will
 *    revert back to its original image when your application
 *    terminates automatically. You do not need to manually restore it.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inImage:
 *      The image you wish to have as your tile image.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An operating system status code.
 *  
 *  Availability:
 *    Non-Carbon CFM:   not available
 *    CarbonLib:        not available in CarbonLib 1.x, is available on Mac OS X version 10.0 and later
 *    Mac OS X:         in version 10.0 and later

 *  OverlayApplicationDockTileImage()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Takes the image passed in and composites it on top of the current
 *    image of your application's dock tile. You might do this to put a
 *    standard badge over your application's icon to indicate something
 *    to the user.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inImage:
 *      The image you wish to overlay onto your tile image.

 *  Result:
 *    An operating system status code.

 *  
 *  Result:

 *  BeginCGContextForApplicationDockTile()

 *  Discussion:
 *    Creates and returns a CGContextRef. You can use this context to

 *    call EndCGContextForApplicationDockTile and NOT CGEndContext when
 *    using this API, as it locks your application's tile in the dock.
 *    If you call CGEndContext, the dock will never know you are done

/*
 *  SetApplicationDockTileMenu()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Sets the menu that is displayed by the application's dock tile.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The Carbon Window Manager and the Dock will always automatically
 *    display a menu containing a list of the application's document
 *    windows. If the application wants to add other additional menu
 *    items, it can use the SetApplicationDockTileMenu API to provide
 *    those items. The items in the specified menu will be combined
 *    with the window title items. This API increments the refcount of
 *    the specified menu. Before the menu is actually displayed, it
 *    will receive kEventMenuPopulate, kEventMenuOpening, and
 *    kEventMenuEnableItems Carbon events, so any event handlers for
 *    these events may update the menu appropriately for the current
 *    state of the application. The application should set a command ID
 *    for each menu item in the dock tile menu, and when that item is
 *    chosen, a kEventCommandProcess Carbon event containing the item's
 *    command ID will be sent to the user focus target.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inMenu:
 *      The menu to display, or NULL to remove the current dock tile
 *      menu.
 *  
 *  Availability:

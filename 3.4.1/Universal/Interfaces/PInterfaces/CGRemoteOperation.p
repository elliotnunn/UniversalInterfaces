	 * This callback may be triggered by drawing operations, window movement, and

 *

{
 * By default, the flags that indicate modifier key state (Command, Alt, Shift, etc.)
 * from the system's keyboard and from other event sources are ORed together as an event is
 * posted into the system, and current key and mouse button state is considered in generating new events.
 * This function allows your application to enable or disable the
 * merging of event state.  When combining is turned off, the event state propagated in the events
 * posted by your app reflect state built up only by your app.  The state within your app's generated
 * event will not be combined with the system's current state, so the system-wide state reflecting key
 * and mouse button state will remain unchanged
 *
 * When called with doCombineState equal to FALSE, this function initializes local (per application)
 * state tracking information to a state of all keys, modifiers, and mouse buttons up.
 *
 * When called with doCombineState equal to TRUE, the current global state of keys, modifiers,
 * and mouse buttons are used in generating events.

{
 * By default the system supresses local hardware events from the keyboard and mouse during
 * a short interval after a synthetic event is posted (see CGSetLocalEventsSuppressionInterval())
 * and while a synthetic mouse drag (mouse movement with the left/only mouse button down).
 * Some classes of applications may want to enable events from some of the local hardware.
 * For example, an app may want to post only mouse events, and so may wish to permit local
 * keyboard hardware events to pass through.
 *
 * This interface lets an app specify a state (event supression interval, or mouse drag), and
 * a mask of event categories to be passed through.

{
 * Some classes of applications need to detect when the window server process dies, or
 * is not running.  The easiest way to do this is to use a CFMachPortRef.
 *
 * If the CoreGraphics window server is not running, this function returns NULL.
 * If the server is running, a CFMachPortRef is returned.
 *
 * A program can register a callback function to use a CFMachPortRef to determine
 * when the CoreGraphics window server exits:
 *
 * static void handleWindowServerDeath( CFMachPortRef port, void *info )
 * (
 *     printf( "Window Server port death detected!\n" );
 *     CFRelease( port );
 *     exit( 1 );
 * )
 * 
 * static void watchForServerDeath()
 * (
 *     CFMachPortRef        port;
 *
 *     port = CGWindowServerCFMachPort();
 *     CFMachPortSetInvalidationCallBack( port, handleWindowServerDeath );
 * )
 *
 * Note that when the window server exits, there may be a few seconds during which
 * no window server is running, until the operating system starts a new
 * window server/loginwindow pair of processes.  This function will return NULL
 * until a new window server is running.
 *
 * Multiple calls to this function may return multiple CFMachPortRefs, each referring
 * to the same Mach port.  Multiple callbacks registered on multiple CFMachPortRefs
 * obtained in this way may fire in a nondetermanistic manner.
 *
 * Your program will need to run a CFRunLoop for the port death
 * callback to function.  A program which does not use a CFRunLoop may use
 * CFMachPortIsValid(CFMachPortRef port) periodically to check if the port is valid.

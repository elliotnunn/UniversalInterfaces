Installing Universal Interfaces into CodeWarrior
=================================================

Version: Universal Interfaces 3.4
Date:    July 11, 2000
Author:  Nick Kledzik


For Pro 5:

	Replace the folder:
		'MacOS Support:Universal:' 
	with the folder:
		'UniversalInterfaces3.4d?:Universal:'
	
	Remove the following folder:
	     'MacOS Support:OpenTransport:'
	Or rename it to:
	     'MacOS Support:(OpenTransport)'
	
	Most of OpenTransport is now integrated into Universal Interfaces.  If you 
	are doing 68K or using the debug libraries from OpenTransport, you will
	want to keep the OpenTransport folder.

	If you are using PowerPlant, you'll need to update LStdControl.h to
	#include <ControlDefinitions.h>

	If you are using MacHeaders, you'll need to add MSL to the access path in
	MacHeaders.mcp because some standard C library headers are now included
	by Universal Interfaces.

	Rebuild any pre-compiled headers you use that were built with older headers.
	The most common is MacHeaders.mcp in MacOS Support:MacHeaders.  But you may
	also need to rebuild MSL or custom precompiled headers in your own projects.
	

For Pro 4:

	In the Finder, do the following:
		
		Universal C headers:
			Drag contents of:
				'UniversalInterfaces3.4d?:Universal:Interfaces:CIncludes:'
			into
				':Metrowerks CodeWarrior:MacOS Support:Headers:Universal Headers:'


		Universal Rez headers:
			Drag contents of:
				'UniversalInterfaces3.4d?:Universal:Interfaces:RIncludes:'
			into
				':Metrowerks CodeWarrior:MacOS Support:Headers:Rez Headers:'
			
			
		Universal Pascal Interfaces:
			Drag contents of:
				'UniversalInterfaces3.4d?:Universal:Interfaces:PInterfaces:'
			into
				':Metrowerks CodeWarrior:MacOS Support:Interfaces:Universal Interfaces:'
			
			
		Stub Libraries:
			Drag contents of:
				'UniversalInterfaces3.4d?:Universal:Libraries:StubLibraries:'
			into
				':Metrowerks CodeWarrior:MacOS Support:Libraries:MacOS Common:'


		PowerPC Libraries:
			Drag contents of:
				'UniversalInterfaces3.4d?:Universal:Libraries:PPCLibraries:'
			into
				':Metrowerks CodeWarrior:MacOS Support:Libraries:MacOS PPC:'


		68k Libraries:
			Drag contents of:
				'UniversalInterfaces3.4d?:Universal:Libraries:Classic68kLibraries:'
			into
				':Metrowerks CodeWarrior:MacOS Support:Libraries:MacOS 68K:MacOS Files:'


	Rebuild any pre-compiled headers you use that were built with older headers.
	The most common is MacHeaders.mcp in MacOS Support:MacHeaders.  But you may
	also need to rebuild MSL or custom precompiled headers in your own projects.

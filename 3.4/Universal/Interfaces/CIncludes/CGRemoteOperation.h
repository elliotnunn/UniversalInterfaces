 * of the number of rectangles in the refreshed areas, and a list of the refreshed
 * rectangles.  The rectangles are in global coordinates.
 *
 * Your function should not modify, deallocate or free memory pointed to by rectArray.
 *
 * The system continues to accumulate refreshed areas constantly.  Whenever new
 * information is available, your callback function is invoked.The list of rects
 * passed to the callback function are cleared from the accumulated refreshed area
 * when the callback is made.
 *
 * This callback may be triggered by drawing operations, window movement, and
 * display reconfiguration.
 *
 * Bear in mind that a single rectangle may occupy multiple displays,
 * either by overlapping the displays, or by residing on coincident displays
 * when mirroring is active.  Use the CGGetDisplaysWithRect() to determine
 * the displays a rectangle occupies.

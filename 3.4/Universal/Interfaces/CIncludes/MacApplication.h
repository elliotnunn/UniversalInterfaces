/*
 *  SetApplicationDockTileImage()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Sets the image for the tile in the dock that represents your
 *    application while it is running. If you set the image, it will
 *    revert back to its original image when your application
 *    terminates automatically. You do not need to manually restore it.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inImage:
 *      The image you wish to have as your tile image.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An operating system status code.
 *  
 *  Availability:
 *    Non-Carbon CFM:   not available
 *    CarbonLib:        not available in CarbonLib 1.x, is available on Mac OS X version 10.0 or later
 *    Mac OS X:         in version 10.0 or later

/*
 *  OverlayApplicationDockTileImage()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Takes the image passed in and composites it on top of the current
 *    image of your application's dock tile. You might do this to put a
 *    standard badge over your application's icon to indicate something
 *    to the user.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inImage:
 *      The image you wish to overlay onto your tile image.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An operating system status code.
 *  
 *  Availability:
 *    Non-Carbon CFM:   not available
 *    CarbonLib:        not available in CarbonLib 1.x, is available on Mac OS X version 10.0 or later

 *  RestoreApplicationDockTileImage()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Restores the tile for your appliation in the dock to its normal
 *    image (your application icon). You would use this if some overlay
 *    or change of the application icon needed to be removed.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An operating system status code.
 *  
 *  Availability:
 *    Non-Carbon CFM:   not available

/*
 *  BeginCGContextForApplicationDockTile()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Creates and returns a CGContextRef. You can use this context to
 *    draw into your application's dock tile with Quartz. You **MUST**
 *    call EndCGContextForApplicationDockTile and NOT CGEndContext when
 *    using this API, as it locks your application's tile in the dock.
 *    If you call CGEndContext, the dock will never know you are done
 *    with the tile.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An Quartz (Core Graphics) context reference.
 *  
 *  Availability:
 *    Non-Carbon CFM:   not available
 *    CarbonLib:        not available in CarbonLib 1.x, is available on Mac OS X version 10.0 or later

 *    as it locks your application's tile in the dock. If you call

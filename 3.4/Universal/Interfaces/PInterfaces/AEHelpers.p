{
 * AEPrintDescToHandle
 *
 * AEPrintDescToHandle provides a way to turn an AEDesc into a textual
 * representation.  This is most useful for debugging calls to
 * AEBuildDesc and friends.  The Handle returned should be disposed by
 * the caller.  The size of the handle is the actual number of
 * characters in the string.

{
 * AEStream:
 *
 * The AEStream interface allows you to build AppleEvents by appending
 * to an opaque structure (an AEStreamRef) and then turning this
 * structure into an AppleEvent.  The basic idea is to open the
 * stream, write data, and then close it - closing it produces an
 * AEDesc, which may be partially complete, or may be a complete
 * AppleEvent.
 }

   If you just want to dispose of the AEStreamRef, you can pass NULL for desc.

   This call lets you augment an existing AppleEvent using the stream
   APIs.  This would be useful, for example, in constructing the reply
   record in an AppleEvent handler.  Note that AEStreamOpenEvent will
   consume the AppleEvent passed in - you can't access it again until the
   stream is closed.  When you're done building the event, AEStreamCloseStream
    will reconstitute it.

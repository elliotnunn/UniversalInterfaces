 *  CFArray
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    CFArray implements an ordered, compact container of pointer-sized
 *    values. Values are accessed via integer keys (indices), from the
 *    range 0 to N-1, where N is the number of values in the array when
 *    an operation is performed. The array is said to be "compact"
 *    because deleted or inserted values do not leave a gap in the key
 *    space -- the values with higher-numbered indices have their
 *    indices renumbered lower (or higher, in the case of insertion) so
 *    that the set of valid indices is always in the integer range [0,
 *    N-1]. Thus, the index to access a particular value in the array
 *    may change over time as other values are inserted into or deleted
 *    from the array. 
 *    
 *    Arrays come in two flavors, immutable, which cannot have values
 *    added to them or removed from them after the array is created,
 *    and mutable, to which you can add values or from which remove
 *    values. Mutable arrays have two subflavors, fixed-capacity, for
 *    which there is a maximum number set at creation time of values
 *    which can be put into the array, and variable capacity, which can
 *    have an unlimited number of values (or rather, limited only by
 *    constraints external to CFArray, like the amount of available
 *    memory). Fixed-capacity arrays can be somewhat higher performing,
 *    if you can put a definate upper limit on the number of values
 *    that might be put into the array. 
 *    
 *    As with all CoreFoundation collection types, arrays maintain hard
 *    references on the values you put in them, but the retaining and
 *    releasing functions are user-defined callbacks that can actually
 *    do whatever the user wants (for example, nothing). 
 *    
 *    Computational Complexity The access time for a value in the array
 *    is guaranteed to be at worst O(lg N) for any implementation,
 *    current and future, but will often be O(1) (constant time).
 *    Linear search operations similarly have a worst case complexity
 *    of O(N*lg N), though typically the bounds will be tighter, and so
 *    on. Insertion or deletion operations will typically be linear in
 *    the number of values in the array, but may be O(N*lg N) clearly
 *    in the worst case in some implementations. There are no favored
 *    positions within the array for performance; that is, it is not
 *    necessarily faster access values with low indices, or to insert
 *    or delete values with high indices, or whatever.

 *      which case the current default CFAllocator is used. If this
 *      reference is not a valid CFAllocator, the behavior is undefined.
 *    
 *    values:
 *      A C array of the pointer-sized values to be in the array. The
 *      values in the array are ordered in the same order in which they
 *      appear in this C array. This parameter may be NULL if the
 *      numValues parameter is 0. This C array is not changed or freed
 *      by this function. If this parameter is not a valid pointer to a
 *      C array of at least numValues pointers, the behavior is
 *      undefined.
 *    
 *    numValues:
 *      The number of values to copy from the values C array into the
 *      CFArray. This number will be the count of the array. If this
 *      parameter is negative, or greater than the number of values
 *      actually in the values C array, the behavior is undefined.
 *    
 *    callBacks:
 *      A pointer to a CFArrayCallBacks structure initialized with the
 *      callbacks for the array to use on each value in the array. The
 *      retain callback will be used within this function, for example,
 *      to retain all of the new values from the values C array. A copy
 *      of the contents of the callbacks structure is made, so that a
 *      pointer to a structure on the stack can be passed in, or can be
 *      reused for multiple array creations. If the version field of
 *      this callbacks structure is not one of the defined ones for
 *      CFArray, the behavior is undefined. The retain field may be
 *      NULL, in which case the CFArray will do nothing to add a retain
 *      to the contained values for the array. The release field may be
 *      NULL, in which case the CFArray will do nothing to remove the
 *      array's retain (if any) on the values when the array is
 *      destroyed. If the copyDescription field is NULL, the array will
 *      create a simple description for the value. If the equal field
 *      is NULL, the array will use pointer equality to test for
 *      equality of values. This callbacks parameter itself may be
 *      NULL, which is treated as if a valid structure of version 0
 *      with all fields NULL had been passed in. Otherwise, if any of
 *      the fields are not valid pointers to functions of the correct

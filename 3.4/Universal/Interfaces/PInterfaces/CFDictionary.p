 *  CFDictionary
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    CFDictionary implements a container which pairs pointer-sized
 *    keys with pointer-sized values. Values are accessed via arbitrary
 *    user-defined keys. A CFDictionary differs from a CFArray in that
 *    the key used to access a particular value in the dictionary
 *    remains the same as values are added to or removed from the
 *    dictionary, unless a value associated with its particular key is
 *    replaced or removed. In a CFArray, the key (or index) used to
 *    retrieve a particular value can change over time as values are
 *    added to or deleted from the array. Also unlike an array, there
 *    is no ordering among values in a dictionary. To enable later
 *    retrieval of a value, the key of the key-value pair should be
 *    constant (or treated as constant); if the key changes after being
 *    used to put a value in the dictionary, the value may not be
 *    retrievable. The keys of a dictionary form a set; that is, no two
 *    keys which are equal to one another are present in the dictionary
 *    at any time. 
 *    
 *    Dictionaries come in two flavors, immutable, which cannot have
 *    values added to them or removed from them after the dictionary is
 *    created, and mutable, to which you can add values or from which
 *    remove values. Mutable dictionaries have two subflavors,
 *    fixed-capacity, for which there is a maximum number set at
 *    creation time of values which can be put into the dictionary, and
 *    variable capacity, which can have an unlimited number of values
 *    (or rather, limited only by constraints external to CFDictionary,
 *    like the amount of available memory). Fixed-capacity dictionaries
 *    can be somewhat higher performing, if you can put a definate
 *    upper limit on the number of values that might be put into the
 *    dictionary. 
 *    
 *    As with all CoreFoundation collection types, dictionaries
 *    maintain hard references on the values you put in them, but the
 *    retaining and releasing functions are user-defined callbacks that
 *    can actually do whatever the user wants (for example, nothing).
 *    
 *    
 *    Although a particular implementation of CFDictionary may not use
 *    hashing and a hash table for storage of the values, the keys have
 *    a hash-code generating function defined for them, and a function
 *    to test for equality of two keys. These two functions together
 *    must maintain the invariant that if equal(X, Y), then hash(X) ==
 *    hash(Y). Note that the converse will not generally be true (but
 *    the contrapositive, if hash(X) != hash(Y), then !equal(X, Y),
 *    will be as required by Boolean logic). If the hash() and equal()
 *    key callbacks are NULL, the key is used as a pointer-sized
 *    integer, and pointer equality is used. Care should be taken to
 *    provide a hash() callback which will compute sufficiently
 *    dispersed hash codes for the key set for best performance.
 *    
 *    
 *    Computational Complexity The access time for a value in the
 *    dictionary is guaranteed to be at worst O(lg N) for any
 *    implementation, current and future, but will often be O(1)
 *    (constant time). Insertion or deletion operations will typically
 *    be constant time as well, but are O(N*lg N) in the worst case in
 *    some implementations. Access of values through a key is faster
 *    than accessing values directly (if there are any such
 *    operations). Dictionaries will tend to use significantly more
 *    memory than a array with the same number of values.

 *    numValues:

 *      integer to compute the hash code. This callbacks parameter
 *      itself may be NULL, which is treated as if a valid structure of

FUNCTION CFNumberGetTypeID: CFTypeID; C;

{
    Creates a CFNumber with the given value. The type of number pointed
    to by the valuePtr is specified by type. If type is a floating point
    type and the value represents one of the infinities or NaN, the
    well-defined CFNumber for that value is returned. If either of
    valuePtr or type is an invalid value, the result is undefined.

FUNCTION CFNumberCreate(allocator: CFAllocatorRef; theType: CFNumberType; valuePtr: UNIV Ptr): CFNumberRef; C;

    Returns the storage format of the CFNumber's value.  Note that
    this is not necessarily the type provided in CFNumberCreate().

FUNCTION CFNumberIsFloatType(number: CFNumberRef): BOOLEAN; C;

{
    Copies the CFNumber's value into the space pointed to by
    valuePtr, as the specified type. If conversion needs to take
    place, the conversion rules follow human expectation and not
    C's promotion and truncation rules. If the conversion is
    lossy, or the value is out of range, FALSE is returned. Best
    attempt at conversion will still be in *valuePtr.

 }
FUNCTION CFNumberGetValue(number: CFNumberRef; theType: CFNumberType; valuePtr: UNIV Ptr): BOOLEAN; C;

{
    Compares the two CFNumber instances. If conversion of the
    types of the values is needed, the conversion and comparison
    follow human expectations and not C's promotion and comparison
    rules. Negative zero compares less than positive zero.
    Positive infinity compares greater than everything except
    itself, to which it compares equal. Negative infinity compares
    less than everything except itself, to which it compares equal.
    Unlike standard practice, if both numbers are NaN, then they
    compare equal; if only one of the numbers is NaN, then the NaN
    compares greater than the other number if it is negative, and
    smaller than the other number if it is positive. (Note that in
    CFEqual() with two CFNumbers, if either or both of the numbers
    is NaN, FALSE is returned.)

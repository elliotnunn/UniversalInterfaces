	    Creates a property list object from its XML description; xmlData should
	    be the raw bytes of that description, possibly the contents of an XML
	    file. Returns NULL if the data cannot be parsed; if the parse fails
	    and errorString is non-NULL, a human-readable description of the failure
	    is returned in errorString. It is the caller's responsibility to release
	    either the returned object or the error string, whichever is applicable.

{
    Returns the XML description of the given object; propertyList must
    be one of the supported property list types, and (for composite types
    like CFArray and CFDictionary) must not contain any elements that
    are not themselves of a property list type. If a non-property list
    type is encountered, NULL is returned. The returned data is
    appropriate for writing out to an XML file. Note that a data, not a
    string, is returned because the bytes contain in them a description
    of the string encoding used.

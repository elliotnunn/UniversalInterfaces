{ Attempts to read the data and properties for the given URL.  If
only interested in one of the resourceData and properties, pass NULL
for the other.  If properties is non-NULL and desiredProperties is
NULL, then all properties are fetched.  Returns success or failure;
note that as much work as possible is done even if FALSE is returned.
So for instance if one property is not available, the others are
fetched anyway. errorCode is set to 0 on success, and some other
value on failure.  If non-NULL, it is the caller 's responsibility
to release resourceData and properties.

    Apple reserves for its use all negative error code values; these
values represent errors common to any scheme.  Scheme-specific error
codes should be positive, non-zero, and should be used only if one of
the predefined Apple error codes does not apply.  Error codes should
be publicized and documented with the scheme-specific properties.

{ Attempts to write the given data and properties to the given URL.
If dataToWrite is NULL, only properties are written out (use
CFURLDestroyResource() to delete a resource).  Properties not present
in propertiesToWrite are left unchanged, hence if propertiesToWrite
is NULL or empty, the URL's properties are not changed at all.

CFURLCreateDataAndPropertiesFromResource(), above.

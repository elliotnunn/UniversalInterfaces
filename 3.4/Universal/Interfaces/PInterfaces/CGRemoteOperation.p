	 * Callback function pointer;
	 * Declare your callback function in this form.  When an area of the display is
	 * modified or refreshed, your callback function will be invoked with a count
	 * of the number of rectangles in the refreshed areas, and a list of the refreshed
	 * rectangles.  The rectangles are in global coordinates.
	 *
	 * Your function should not modify, deallocate or free memory pointed to by rectArray.
	 *
	 * The system continues to accumulate refreshed areas constantly.  Whenever new
	 * information is available, your callback function is invoked.The list of rects
	 * passed to the callback function are cleared from the accumulated refreshed area
	 * when the callback is made.
	 *
	 * This callback may be triggered by drawing operations, window movement, and
	 * display reconfiguration.
	 *
	 * Bear in mind that a single rectangle may occupy multiple displays,
	 * either by overlapping the displays, or by residing on coincident displays
	 * when mirroring is active.  Use the CGGetDisplaysWithRect() to determine
	 * the displays a rectangle occupies.

 * Posting events: These functions post events into the system.  Use for remote
 * operation and virtualization.
 *
 * Note that remote operation requires a valid connection to the server, which
 * must be owned by either the root/Administrator user or the logged in console
 * user.  This means that your application must be running as root/Administrator
 * user or the logged in console user.

 *
 * All keystrokes needed to generate a character must be entered, including
 * SHIFT, CONTROL, OPTION, and COMMAND keys.  For example, to produce a 'Z',
 * the SHIFT key must be down, the 'z' key must go down, and then the SHIFT
 * and 'z' key must be released:
 *  CGPostKeyboardEvent( (CGCharCode)0, (CGKeyCode)56, true ); // shift down
 *  CGPostKeyboardEvent( (CGCharCode)'Z', (CGKeyCode)6, true ); // 'z' down
 *  CGPostKeyboardEvent( (CGCharCode)'Z', (CGKeyCode)6, false ); // 'z' up

 * the machine's keyboard and mouse).  This may be done either as a
 * explicit request (tracked per app) or as a short term side effect of
 * posting an event.
 *
 * CGInhibitLocalEvents() is typically used for long term remote operation
 * of a system, as in automated system testing or telecommuting applications.
 * Local device state changes are discarded.
 *
 * Local event inhibition is turned off if the app that requested it terminates.

 * CGAssociateMouseAndMouseCursorPosition(false) has the same effect
 * as the following, without actually modifying the supression interval:
 *
 *  CGSetLocalEventsSuppressionInterval(MAX_DOUBLE);
 *  CGWarpMouseCursorPosition(currentPosition);
 *
 * While disconnected, mouse move and drag events will reflect the current position of
 * the mouse cursor position, which will not change with mouse movement. Use the
 * <CoreGraphics/CGDirectDisplay.h> function:
 *
 *  void CGGetLastMouseDelta( CGMouseDelta * deltaX, CGMouseDelta * deltaY );
 *
 * This will report mouse movement associated with the last mouse move or drag event.
 *
 * To update the display cursor position, use the function defined in this module:
 *
 *  CGEventErr CGWarpMouseCursorPosition( CGPoint newCursorPosition );

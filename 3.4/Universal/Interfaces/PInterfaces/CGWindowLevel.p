 * Windows may be assigned to a particular level. When assigned to a level,
 * the window is ordered relative to all other windows in that level.
 * Windows with a higher level are sorted in front of windows with a lower
 * level.
 *
 * A common set of window levels is defined here for use within higher
 * level frameworks.  The levels are accessed via a key and function,
 * so that levels may be changed or adjusted in future releases without
 * breaking binary compatability.

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The FSpOpenMappedFile function opens the fork specified by the

{
 *  OpenMappedScratchFile()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Creates and opens a scratch file with the privileges requested
 *    for use as backing storage.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The OpenMappedScratchFile function creates a file with the size
 *    specified by the fileSize parameter on the volume specified by
 *    the volume parameter. If kFSInvalidVolumeRefNum is passed as the
 *    volume parameter, the system code will choose the location of the
 *    file. OpenMappedScratchFile then opens the file and returns a
 *    BackingFileID in the backingFile parameter. You can pass the
 *    BackingFileID to other routines which accept a BackingFileID as
 *    an input parameter. The privileges parameter specifies what
 *    operations you want to perform on the mapped file fork. Programs
 *    can request either kCanReadMappedFile privileges, or both
 *    kCanReadMappedFile and kCanWriteMappedFile privileges. To disable
 *    Process Manager tracking of the mapped file fork and its mapped
 *    file views, you may also request kNoProcessMappedFile privileges.
 *    The data for a scratch file is only valid in an open mapped file
 *    view. When a mapped file view is first created for a scratch file
 *    with MapFileView, data on disk is not paged into memory. When
 *    that mapped file view is unmapped with UnmapFileView, changes are
 *    not flushed from memory to disk.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    volume:
 *      The volume where scratch file should be created or
 *      kFSInvalidVolumeRefNum to let the system choose the volume.
 *    
 *    fileSize:
 *      The size of the scratch file.
 *    
 *    privileges:
 *      The requested MappingPrivileges.
 *    
 *    backingFile:
 *      Receives a BackingFileID which you can use to access the mapped
 *      file fork.

{
 *  MapFileView()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Creates a mapped file view into a mapped file fork.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The MapFileView function creates a mapped file view into the
 *    mapped file fork specified by the backingFile parameter.
 *    MapFileView returns a FileViewID in the theView parameter. You
 *    can pass the FileViewID to other routines which accept a
 *    FileViewID as an input parameter. The backingBase and
 *    backingLength parameters specify what part of the mapped file
 *    fork will be mapped to memory. The access parameter specifies the
 *    allowable access to the memory in a mapped file view. The
 *    guardLength parameter specifies the size, in bytes, of the
 *    excluded logical address ranges to place adjacent to each end of
 *    the mapped file view. The options parameter specifies the desired
 *    characteristics of the mapped file view. The viewBase parameter,
 *    as an optional input, specifies the requested viewBase. The
 *    backingBase parameter must be a whole multiple of the logical
 *    page size. If kMapEntireFork is passed as backingLength, accesses
 *    past the mapped file fork's logical end-of-file will not cause
 *    exceptions, but will have undefined behavior. Only accesses up to
 *    viewLength should be considered valid. The starting address of
 *    the mapped file view is returned in the viewBase parameter. The
 *    length of the mapped file view is returned in the viewLength
 *    parameter.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    backingFile:
 *      The mapped file fork to create a mapped file view from.
 *    
 *    backingBase:
 *      Pointer to the offset into mapped file fork. Passing a NULL
 *      pointer is the same as passing an offset of zero.
 *    
 *    backingLength:
 *      The number of bytes to map, or kMapEntireFork to map from
 *      backingBase to the mapped file fork's logical end-of-file.
 *    
 *    access:
 *      The FileViewAccess.

 *      The desired characteristics of the mapped file view.

 *    Gets a list of mapped file views.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The GetNextView function returns the FileViewID of the mapped
 *    file view next in the list of mapped file views. You can
 *    enumerate through the list of mapped file views by passing
 *    kInvalidID as the theView parameter and then repetitively calling
 *    GetNextView with the last FileViewID returned until the result
 *    code vmNoMoreFileViewsErr is returned.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    theView:
 *      Input: The last FileViewID returned by GetNextView, or
 *      kInvalidID to get the first mapped file view. Output: If noErr,
 *      receives the FileViewID of the next mapped file view.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An operating system result code: noErr, paramErr,

    Frac2X, Fix2X, X2Fix, and X2Frac translate to and from
    the floating point type "extended" (that's what the X is for).
    On the original Mac this was 80-bits and the functions could be
    accessed via A-Traps.  When the 68881 co-processor was added,
    it used 96-bit floating point types, so the A-Traps could not 
    be used.  When PowerPC was added, it used 64-bit floating point
    types, so yet another prototype was added.

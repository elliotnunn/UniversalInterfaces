    NOTE
    
    The file "Memory.h" has been renamed to "MacMemory.h" to prevent a collision
    with the "Memory.h" available on other platforms.  MacOS only developers may 
    continue to use #include <Memory.h>.  Developers doing cross-platform work where 
    Memory.h also exists should change their sources to use #include <MacMemory.h>

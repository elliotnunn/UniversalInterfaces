{ <--- function returns OSStatus of the operation.  noErr will be returned if valid, kNSLUserCanceled will be returned if the user cancels }
{ ---> dialogOptions }
{ ---> eventProc }
{ ---> eventProcContextPtr }
{ ---> filterProc }
{ ---> serviceTypeList }
{ <--- userSelectedURL }
{ NSLDialogOptions* dialogOptions }
{
   dialogOptions is a user defined structure defining the look, feel and operation of NSLStandardGetURL dialog
   default behavior can be achieved by passing in a pointer to a structure that has been filled out by a previous
   call to NSLGetDefaultDialogOptions or by passing in NULL.
}
{ NSLEventUPP eventProc }
{
   the eventProc is a callback NSLURLFilterUPP that will
   get called with Events that the dialog doesn't handle.  If you pass in nil,
   you won't get update events while the NSLStandardGetURL dialog is open.
}
{ void* eventProcContextPtr }
{  you can provide a pointer to some contextual data that you want to have sent to your eventProc filter }
{ NSLURLFilterProcPtr filterProc }
{
   the filter param is a callback NSLURLFilterUPP that
   will get called (if not nil) for each url that is going to be displayed in
   the dialog's result list.  A result of false will not include the url for the
   user to select from.  You also have the option of handling the way the url looks
   in the dialog listing by copying the preferred name into the displayString
   parameter.  (If left alone, NSLStandardGetURL dialog will strip the service type
   portion off the url).
}
{ char* serviceTypeList }
{
   the serviceTypeList parameter is a null terminated string that will 
   directly affect the contents of the services popup in the dialog.
   The structure of this string is a set of tuples as follows:
   Name of ServiceType as to be represented in the popup followed by
   a comma delimted list of service descriptors (ie http,https) that will
   used in the search of that type.  Each comma delimited tuple is delimited
   by semi-colons.
}
{
   For example:
   If you want to search for services of type http (web), https (secure web),
   and ftp, you could pass in the string "Web Servers,http,https;FTP Servers,ftp".
   This would result in a popup list with two items ("Web Servers" and "FTP Servers")
   and searches performed on them will provide results of type http and https for the
   first, and ftp for the second.
}

{
   Results list Icons:
   NSLStandardGetURL provides icons in its listings for the following types:
   "http", "https", "ftp", "afp", "lpr", "LaserWriter", "AFPServer"
   any other types will get a generic icon.  However, you can provide icons
   if you wish by including an '#ics8' resource id at the end of your comma
   delimited list.  The dialog will then use that icon if found in its results
   list.  This icon will be used for all types in a tuple.
   For example:
   The param "Web Servers,http,https;Telnet Servers,telnet;NFS Servers,nfs,129"
   would result in lists of http and https services to be shown with their default
   icons, telnet servers would be shown with the default misc. icon and nfs
   servers would be shown with your icon at resource id 129.
}

{ char** url }
{
   pass in the address of a char* and it will point to the resulting url.  If the user
   cancels (the function returns false), the pointer will be set to nil.  If the function
   returns true (user selected a url), then you must call NSLFreeURL on the pointer when
   you are done with it.
}
{
   Call this to have the user select a url based service from a dialog.
   Function takes on input an optional filter proc, a serviceTypeList, and an address to a Ptr.
   Function sets the value of the Ptr to a newly created c-style null terminated string
   containing the user's choice of URL.

   OTKERNEL is used to indicate whether the code is being built
   for the kernel environment.  It defaults to 0.  If you include
   "OpenTransportKernel.h" before including this file,
   it will be 1 and you will only be able to see stuff available
   to kernel code.

{
   OTUNIXERRORS determines whether this file defines a bunch of
   common UNIX error codes, like EPERM.  Typically, client code does
   not want to do this because of the possibility of a clash with
   other code modules, like the standard C libraries, that also
   defines these routines.  However, client code can turn it on to
   get these definitions.  This might be done by protocol stack
   infrastructure, or some other low-level code.
   "OpenTransportKernel.i" sets this flag before include
   "OpenTransport.h" because kernel modules typically need these
   error codes.  Note that kernel modules shouldn't be including
   standard C libraries, so this is rarely a problem.
   In general, the clash between OT and standard C definitions
   of these error codes is rarely a problem becasue both OT
   and the C libraries define them to have the same value.  But
   I'm sure this check is useful to some people.

{
   OTDEBUG is used to control the behaviour of the OT debugging
   macros.  If you set it to non-zero, the macros will generate code
   that drops you into the debugger.  If you set it to 0, or leave it
   undefined, the macros are compiled out.
   Setting up this compiler variable is a little tricky because previous
   versions of the OT interfaces used a different variable, qDebug.
   We replaced qDebug with OTDEBUG because qDebug does not fit into
   the OT namespace.  But I didn't want to break a lot of currently
   building code.  The following tricky compiler variable footwork
   avoids this.
   There are four outcomes when this code is compiled, depending on
   whether qDebug and OTDEBUG are defined beforehand.  The following
   table shows the outcome in each case.
   qDebug     OTDEBUG    Outcome       Explanation  
   ------     -------    -------       -----------
   defined    defined    OTDEBUG wins  Mixed legacy and new code, we believe the new code.
   defined    undefined  qDebug wins   Legacy code.

   ***** Normalise 68K Calling C Conventions *****
   Define special types that handle the difference in parameter passing
   between different Mac OS C compilers when generating 68K code.  OT
   exports C calling conventions routines, and various C compilers use
   various different conventions.  Differences in the placement of the result
   are covered above, where we output pragma pointers_in_D0.  The other big
   difference is how the compilers pass integer parameters less than 32 bits.
   The MPW compiler always extends these to 32 bits; other compilers simply
   push a value of the appropriate size.  We overcome this difference by
   defining special OTFooParam types, which are only used when passing
   sub 32 bit values to routines.  They are always defined to a 32 bit
   size, which makes all the compilers do the same thing.
   One weird consequence of this is that in more strict type checking
   languages (eg Pascal) OTBooleanParam is not compatible with Boolean.
   Sorry.

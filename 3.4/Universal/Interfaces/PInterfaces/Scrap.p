    While were in here mucking about, we defined a new type to
    to put some confusion to rest. The old calls, as well as the
    new calls, use the new type. Existing clients should be
    blissfully ignorant.

	    X, the scrap is held by the pasteboard server instead of in a
	    handle in your app's heap, so LoadScrap and UnloadScrap do
	    nothing when called under Mac OS X.

    data is available. GetScrapFlavorSize is intended as a prelude
    to allocating memory and calling GetScrapFlavorData.

    ClearCurrentScrap clears the current scrap. Call this
    first when the user requests a Copy or Cut operation --
    even if you maintain a private scrap! You should not wait
    until receiving a suspend event to call ClearCurrentScrap. Call
    it immediately after the user requests a Copy or Cut operation.
    You don't need to put any data on the scrap immediately (although
    it's perfectly fine to do so). You DO need to call GetCurrentScrap
    after ClearCurrentScrap so you'll have a valid ScrapRef to pass
    to other functions.

FUNCTION ClearCurrentScrap: OSStatus;

{
    PutScrapFlavor is a lot like PutScrap, with two differences:
    we added a ScrapRef parameter at the beginning and you can
    "promise" various aspects of a flavor. If you pass a NIL
    data pointer, this is a promise that in the future you
    will provide data for this flavor. Provide the data
    through a subsequent call to PutScrapFlavor, either later
    in the same code flow or during a scrap promise keeper proc.
    If you know how big the data is, you can pass the size as
    well, and this may allow subsequent callers of GetScrapFlavorInfo
    to avoid blocking. If you don't know the size, pass -1.
    If you pass a 0 size, you are telling Scrap Manager not to
    expect any data for this flavor. In this case, the flavor
    data pointer is ignored. NOTE: the last time you can provide
    scrap flavor data is when your scrap promise keeper gets
    called. It is NOT possible to call PutScrapFlavor while
    handling a suspend event; suspend events under Carbon
    simply don't work the way they do under Mac OS 8.

    ScrapPromiseKeeper is a function you write which is called by
    Scrap Manager as needed to keep your earlier promise of a
    particular scrap flavor. When your function is called, deliver
    the requested data by calling PutScrapFlavor.

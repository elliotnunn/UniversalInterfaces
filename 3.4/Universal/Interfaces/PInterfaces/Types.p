    NOTE
    
    The file "Types.h" has been renamed to "MacTypes.h" to prevent a collision
    with the "Types.h" available on other platforms.  MacOS only developers may 
    continue to use #include <Types.h>.  Developers doing cross-platform work where 
    Types.h also exists should change their sources to use #include <MacTypes.h>

    NOTE
    
    The file Windows.h has been renamed to "MacWindows.h" to prevent a collision
    with the Microsoft Windows(tm) header file "Windows.h".  MacOS only developers may 
    continue to use #include <Windows.h>.  Developers doing cross-platform work where 
    Windows.h also exists should change their sources to use #include <MacWindows.h>
